## XPath Guide

XML path language

Selects xml path selecting nodes from xml document but can use to select elements from html pages. Another way is CSS, its used to style web pages. We will use XPath cuz its easy.

//tagName = basic way to locate element or node. If you want to select all h1 elements you use //h1. pick a matching element that is at any position. 

Can select a position

//tagName\[1\]

Like //h1\[1\]

//tagname\[@attributeName="Value"\]
is used for average Xpath expression.

XPath functions to are used to find specific values 

starts-with() text at begging 
contain() contains text

To wrap the attribute name in attr value

//tagname\[@attributeName, "Value"\]

Can use and or 

//tagname\[(expression 1) and (expression 2)\]
