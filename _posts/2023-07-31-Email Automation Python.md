Activate 2FA on your google account.

Then navigate to apppasswords

If you have a sslcertverificationerror you need to find Install Certificates.command and then double click and install certs. 

```python
import smtplib
import ssl
import os
#This library comes with python
from email.message import EmailMessage


# Define email sender and receiver
email_sender = 'cyb3rbu7n7@gmail.com'
email_password = os.environ.get("EMAIL_PASSWORD")
#email_password = 'write-password-here'
email_receiver = 'corybcrook@gmail.com'

# Set the subject and body of the email
subject = "Im a automater"
body = """
I'm now a hacker go check out the blog post!!! https://heckintechin.tech/posts/Email-Automation-Python/
"""

#Create email element then add all the variables as elements
em = EmailMessage()
em['From'] = email_sender
em['To'] = email_receiver
em['Subject'] = subject
em.set_content(body)

# Add SSL (layer of security)
context = ssl.create_default_context()

# Log in and send the email
with smtplib.SMTP_SSL('smtp.gmail.com', 465, context=context) as smtp:
    smtp.login(email_sender, email_password)
    smtp.send_message(em)
    print('Email sent successfully')

```

## Add Attachments

I added the attachment code for imghdr and then new it wouldn't work when I uploaded a PDF instead of an image.  So I asked chat GPT to read in a file and send it. 

```Python
import smtplib
import ssl
import os
#This library comes with python
from email.message import EmailMessage
import imghdr

# Define email sender and receiver
email_sender = 'cyb3rbu7n7@gmail.com'
email_password = os.environ.get("EMAIL_PASSWORD")
#email_password = 'write-password-here'
email_receiver = 'corybcrook@gmail.com'

# Set the subject and body of the email
subject = "Im a automater"
body = """
I'm now a hacker go check out the blog post!!! https://heckintechin.tech/posts/Email-Automation-Python/
"""

#Create email element then add all the variables as elements
em = EmailMessage()
em['From'] = email_sender
em['To'] = email_receiver
em['Subject'] = subject
em.set_content(body)

# Attach File rb stands for read bytes smf read in a image file
#with open('CyberSec_Resume_7-18-23.pdf') as file:
#    file_data = file.read()
#    file_type = imghdr.what(file.name)
#    file_name = file.name 
#em.add_attachment(file_data, filename=file_name, subtype=file_type, maintype='image')

with open('CyberSec_Resume_7-18-23.pdf', 'rb') as file:
    file_data = file.read()
    file_name = file.name
em.add_attachment(file_data, filename=file_name, maintype='application', subtype='octet-stream')

# Add SSL (layer of security)
context = ssl.create_default_context()

# Log in and send the email
with smtplib.SMTP_SSL('smtp.gmail.com', 465, context=context) as smtp:
    smtp.login(email_sender, email_password)
    smtp.send_message(em)
    print('Email sent successfully')
```
