You have to set the score and force the round variable to be four then you can trigger the game status variable and you have a win sequence. 

### Fix `roundComplete` and Trigger a Win
Run the following commands in sequence in the browser console:

```javascript
// Set roundComplete to maximum
// This forces the game to recognize all rounds as completed.
sessionStorage.setItem('roundComplete', '4'); // Max rounds completed
roundComplete = 4;

// Set a high score
// Ensures the score is above the high score threshold to trigger the win state.
sessionStorage.setItem('score', '50001'); // Higher than highScore
score = 50001;

// Manually trigger gameStatus
// Calls the function that checks for game completion and processes the win sequence.
gameStatus();
```

Can do all the levels without any game modification but the hidden end level is where I decided to explore into the console where i then navigated to the entitites vm guid.js scripts.

For now im stuck on this one and need to think about how to access the games entities and something else.
