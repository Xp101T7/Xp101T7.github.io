## Proxmox 7.4 Setup May 2023


Download Rufus and the proxmox image

```bash
https://rufus.ie/en/
```

Flash the Proxmox iso using rufus. Just next and ignore the error message about hybridISO and DD usage.

Plug the USB into the host computer and fire it up. Check out this site for easy BIOS access to modify boot order.

Make sure you run through the Post-Install Scripts by tteck check out his github if you want to see the actual scripts they look clean.

Fairly simple to finish the build unless you want to customize the storage clusters. 

## Changing the IP Address of Your Proxmox Server

If your an dummy and save a server to same address as your other proxmox server its easy as cake 🍰 to change.
[How to Change Primary Proxmox VE IP Address - ServeTheHome](https://www.servethehome.com/how-to-change-primary-proxmox-ve-ip-address/)

Just Change the /etc/network/interfaces and /etc/hosts file and the reboot.

## Refreshing Second Node 

To refresh the second server I first backed the VM's up to my OpenMediaVault NAS.  By going to Datacenter > Storage > Add > SMB/CIFS > then logging into my NAS > then going to the VM > Backups > and selecting to backup to Backups NAS folder.

I backed all my VM's up before server wipe so that I could just fresh install proxmox and run post-install scripts then cluster join the second node.
