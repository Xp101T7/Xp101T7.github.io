## Web Servers

In a web app the machine running the webapp is the server and the browser is the client. 

Server side code or backend code is requested JAVA, Python, JS. The response is front end usually, html, CSS, javascript. Both are written together. 


springboot framework we can define mappings for http calls like /product calls to return products from the DB. 

Then the Jquery client side code sends back this info. 

python or nodejs web frameworks are the same for being able to receive requests and respond. python flask can run the web server code natively but its not recommended. The web server hosts the application the code can be run on. The code doesn't need to be in the OG format but it can be in a package like with Java. 

Apache Tomcat, NGINX, gunicorn are examples of servers that can host web servers, the server can run one or more processes that listen on a specific port.  Apache 8080, NGINX = 80, Gunicorn = 8000 by default.  Web servers can host multiple apps at the same time. 


## Static and Dynamic Websites

A site containing only pics that don't change is a static website. 

Ecommerce though is dynamic because it often has a backend to process purchases and orders. But will also contain static content alongside the processing payment code.
