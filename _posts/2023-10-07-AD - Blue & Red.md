## AD - Blue & Red

I've compiled a list of resources based on the topics from the document "Red vs. Blue: Modern Active Directory Attacks, Detection, & Protection" that you provided. Below is a tabular representation of the resources which are categorized under Red Team (Offensive) and Blue Team (Defensive) strategies concerning Active Directory security:
