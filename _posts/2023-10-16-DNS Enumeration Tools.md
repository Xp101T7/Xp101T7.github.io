## DNS Enumeration Tools - (Created by ME)

I have created some python DNS enumeration tools. There is a DNS recon tool and Sub Domain Recon Tool.

In order to run these tools all you have to install python from python.org or from the Microsoft store.

Then navigate to my repository and download the zip files > extract > run > allow the file to run > follow directions below > results.

I will code sign these executables soon.

If all sub domains are PWN_ABLE from your list then the domain is enumrating wonky!!! I'm looking into making the tools output errors when this is occuring... Future Release...

Also adding a Completed Notification!!! Coming Soon...
