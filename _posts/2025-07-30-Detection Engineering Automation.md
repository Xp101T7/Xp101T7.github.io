## Detection Engineering Automation CI/CD Pipeline

# Building a Dev Environment
- Focus on **prioritizing and automating collection** of threatâ€‘focused artifacts to build detection use cases before full CI/CD deployment 
- Covers:
  - Scoping threatâ€‘based inputs
  - Parsing indicators & payloads
  - Leveraging context enrichment 

## âœ… Technical Requirements
- Chrome (or Chromiumâ€‘based) browser, internet access (e.g. to Chronicle Lab)
- Pythonâ€¯3.9+ (with pip access) and code editor (e.g. VSCode)
- Ubuntuâ€¯22.04 Desktop VM (â‰ˆ8â€¯GB RAM, 4 vCPU)
- Wazuhâ€¯EDR agent installation on supported OS
- pfSense Community Edition VM (â‰¥2â€¯GB RAM, 2 CPU cores, v2.7.x recommended)
- Optionally: CrowdStrike Falcon trial/admin access {index=3}
- Alternatively, use GCP VMs with IAP tunnels if resources constrained (cost warning) 

## ðŸŽ¯ Chapter Goals
- Help team **scope high-value threat artifacts** (IOCs, payloads) aligned to business context
- Automate extraction and **parsing of indicators/payloads**
- Show how to **apply parsed IOCs** directly to security tooling (e.g. blocklists, agents)
- Enrich parsed outputs with threatÂ Intel and business context to create prioritized use cases 

## ðŸ§  Core Topics & Labs
- **Scoping Threat-Based Inputs**
  - How to prioritize which artifacts to process for early detection use-case benefit
- **Parsing Indicators & Payloads**
  - Automate IOC and payload extraction via Python code (e.g. STIX2 JSON parser)
  - Labs:
    - Labâ€¯2.1: Custom STIX2 JSON parser
    - Labâ€¯2.2: Autoâ€‘blocking domains via intel feed
    - Labâ€¯2.3: Ingest malicious hashes into Wazuh EDR
    - Labâ€¯2.4: Deploy custom IOCs to CrowdStrike 

- **Context Enrichment**
  - Augment IOCs with threatâ€‘intel and business metadata
  - Labâ€¯2.5: Analyze and develop custom detections in Google Chronicle 

## âœ… Key Outcomes
- Automated parsing of IOCs/payloads as usable building blocks
- Direct ingestion/deployment of indicators into defense tooling (Wazuh, CrowdStrike, Chronicle)
- Ability to create **enriched, highâ€‘fidelity detection use cases** aligned to threat and business context
- Prepares the inputs and mindset required for downstream CI/CD pipeline automation

## ðŸ“š Further Reading
- Risk scoring and prioritization techniques for use cases (e.g. scoring quick wins)
