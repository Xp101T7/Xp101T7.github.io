Pentesting is primarily concerned with identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities within a specific target system, striving to uncover as many weaknesses as possible. 
This process aids in shoring up an organization's defenses by pinpointing areas of vulnerability.

On the other hand, a red team engagement shifts its focus. Instead of merely finding vulnerabilities, it aims to assess an organization's defensive capabilities by simulating real-world attacks. 
The goal is to evaluate how well the organization can detect and respond to these simulated threat actors.
