## SANS DFIR - # Stay Ahead of Ransomware Livestream Series - Episode 2


Shoutout to this new series from SANS DFIR wizard Ryan Chapman and wizardris Mari DeGrazia.

This talk touches on some juicy info about modern rasomware trends. Intrestingly enough they speak about things a bit different than some of the paid threat intel firms I have communicated with in the last few months. 

Check out the extracted links from this Talk and also give it a watch.
