State can be tracked from terraform and if a change is made not in terraform then terraform will switch it back over bc its defualt. There is a terraform manifest file.

Changes need to be run from the terraform then run `teraform apply`

Terraform is more of an IAC deployment and provisioning tool. 

Ansible is used for post config activities and uses playbooks. 

Monitoring the servers with Prometheus its collects metrics and stores them locally, Grafana helps make sense of the data using charts and graphs. 

All of this is CI/CD when completed.
